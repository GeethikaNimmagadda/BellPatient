	<li> Cardiology 
		<p>  Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can no longer provide enough blood to keep up with your body’s needs.

Heart failure can be caused by several different problems, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, heart attack or congenital heart problems.

In many cases, heart failure can be treated effectively with medications. When medications do not help and symptoms become severe, a heart transplant may need to be considered.

A heart transplant can restore the health and energy you had prior to heart failure. There are many important risks to consider, though, and patients requiring a heart transplant may encounter long waits for a donor heart.

How it’s done
Prior to a heart transplant, your cardiologist must determine if this surgery is appropriate for you.  For example, you may not be considered a good candidate for a heart transplant if you have other serious medical conditions, or if you are older than 65.

Once you have been identified as suitable for a heart transplant, you need to wait for a donor heart to become available. This can take many months. During this time, your doctors and nurses work with you to help you manage your heart failure.

When a donor heart becomes available, you are notified immediately. The heart transplant must be performed right away, while the donor heart is still healthy.

Heart transplant surgery takes four hours or longer. You are put under general anesthesia and a heart lung machine takes over supplying blood to your body. Your diseased heart is removed and the donor heart is sewn in place. Donor hearts often start beating on their own. Otherwise, your surgeon will stimulate it to start beating with an electric shock.

Most patients remain in the hospital for 7-14 days after a heart transplant. The recovery period at home takes several months, and requires the support of family and friends. There are certain medications you will have to take for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting your new heart.

Many patients with heart transplants have lived 10 years or more with their new hearts.<br>
		Risks
There are two kinds of risks associated with heart surgery: The risks of the surgery itself, and the risks of living with a new heart.

Infection
Reaction to anesthesia
Rejection of your new heart
Arterial problems
Kidney damage from immunosuppressant drugs
Cancer caused by immunosuppressant drugs
Death

	<li> Dental Care 
		<p>Professional dental cleaning. During a typical checkup your dentist or dental hygienist will remove the plaque and tartar (plaque that builds up and hardens on the tooth surface and can only be removed with professional cleaning) from above and below the gum line of all teeth. If you have some signs of gum disease, your dentist may recommend professional dental cleaning more than twice-a-year.
Scaling and root planing. This is a deep-cleaning, nonsurgical procedure, done under a local anesthetic, whereby plaque and tartar from above and below the gum line are scraped away (scaling) and rough spots on the tooth root are made smooth (planing). Smoothing the rough spots removes bacteria and provides a clean surface for the gums to reattach to the teeth. Scaling and root planing is done if your dentist or periodontist determines that you have plaque and calculus (hardened plaque, also called tartar) under the gums that needs to be removed.
Surgical Treatments for Gum Disease
Some treatments for gum disease are surgical. Some examples are:

Flap surgery/pocket reduction surgery. During this procedure the gums are lifted back and the tarter is removed. In some cases, irregular surfaces of the damaged bone are smoothed to limit areas where disease-causing bacteria can hide. The gums are then placed so that the tissue fits snugly around the tooth. This method reduces the size of the space between the gum and tooth, thereby decreasing the areas where harmful bacteria can grow and decreasing the chance of serious health problems associated with periodontal disease.
Bone grafts. This procedure involves using fragments of your own bone, synthetic bone, or donated bone to replace bone destroyed by gum disease. The grafts serve as a platform for the regrowth of bone, which restores stability to teeth. New technology, called tissue engineering, encourages your own body to regenerate bone and tissue at an accelerated rate.
Soft tissue grafts. This procedure reinforces thin gums or fills in places where gums have receded. Grafted tissue, most often taken from the roof of the mouth, is stitched in place, adding tissue to the affected area.
Guided tissue regeneration. Performed when the bone supporting your teeth has been destroyed, this procedure stimulates bone and gum tissue growth. Done in combination with flap surgery, a small piece of mesh-like fabric is inserted between the bone and gum tissue. This keeps the gum tissue from growing into the area where the bone should be, allowing the bone and connective tissue to regrow to better support the teeth.
Bone surgery. Smoothes shallow craters in the bone due to moderate and advanced bone loss. Following flap surgery, the bone around the tooth is reshaped to decrease the craters. This makes it harder for bacteria to collect and grow.
In some patients, the nonsurgical procedure of scaling and root planing is all that is needed to treat gum diseases. Surgery is needed when the tissue around the teeth is unhealthy and cannot be repaired with nonsurgical options.</p>

How Are Ear Infections Diagnosed?
If you or your child has an earache that is accompanied (in some cases) by a stuffy or runny nose and a sore throat and fever, it is likely that the ear pain is due to an ear infection.

Your doctor will examine the eardrum with an instrument called an otoscope for signs of infection -- not an easy task if the patient is a fussy infant. The doctor may also check for blockage or filling of the middle ear using a pneumatic otoscope, which blows a little air at the eardrum. This air should cause the eardrum to move a little back and forth. If fluid is present, the eardrum will not move as readily.

Another test for ear infections is tympanometry, which uses sound and air pressure to check for fluid in the middle ear. If needed, an audiologist will perform a hearing test to determine if there is hearing loss.

On rare occasions, when the person is quite ill, a doctor may make an opening in the eardrum, draw out a sample of fluid from the middle ear to culture the sample in a lab. This more extreme measure is usually used only for serious or particularly stubborn infections.

What Are the Treatments for Ear Infections?
The goal of treatment for most doctors is to rid the middle ear of infection before more serious complications set in. Treatment usually involves eliminating the causes of the ear infection and killing any invading bacteria in the Eustachian tube.

Medicine for Ear Infections
An ear infection is often caused by a virus, in which case the only relief doctors can offer is treatment of the symptoms. To ease the pain of an ear infection, your doctor may recommend a pain reliever, typically acetaminophen or ibuprofen, which also helps reduce a fever. Aspirin should be avoided in children because of the threat of Reye's syndrome. Pain can also be reduced by using gentle heat from a heating pad, but be very careful when using heating pads with children.

Sometimes, it is difficult for your doctor to tell with an otoscope alone if the ear infection is caused by a virus or bacteria, so deciding on a proper course of treatment isn't always easy. A debate over using antibiotics (bacteria-killing drugs) to treat middle ear infections arose in the 1990’s as more bacteria became resistant to antibiotics. Some doctors initially treat only the symptoms of an ear infection, without antibiotics, a response that has been supported by several studies.
